A tessellation game. 

WARNING

I made this game with the sole purpose of learning, both the (almost)
complete design of one of the simplest games, and the internals of the
V9990 P1 mode.

This software has been developed in Linux, and tested on the OpenMSX 
emulator only.

TODO

Add some screenshots.

REQUIREMENTS

* MSX with 8kb RAM
* V9990
* wla-z80 assembler (www.villehelin.com/wla.html) and make to build the rom

GAME PLAY

* Objective
Tesselate the given part of the plane as best as you can.

* Controls
Left, right.
Space -> rotate block.
Down -> increase block speed (keep pressed)

* Levels
The level is increased after 16, 32, 64, and 128 lines are completed.
Of course, a level increase leads to faster falling blocks.

* Score
Setting a block: 1pt.
Completing one line: 16pt.
Completing two lines: 32pt.
Completing three lines: 64pt.
Completing four lines: 128pt.

* Bonus
The game starts at bonus level of 1, and the maximum bonus level is 8.
Each bonus level doubles the points obtained. The bonus level is
increased for every QUAD that is completed (clearing 4 lines
simultaneously). If 3 lines are cleared simultaneously, the bonus 
level is unchanged. In the remaining two cases, the bonus level is
decreased by one.  

KNOWN ISSUES

The code is rather ugly, experimental and not optimized. It had a good 
start, and ended badly. It is a sort of 'lets get the things done'
code.

The game lacks sound and music.

The game lacks intro screen and credits.

There is a problem with the movement of the falling block. Seldom
there is a mismatch between the sprite that represents the block and
the position in the RAM. I cannot reproduce this behavior at will, so
it is very probable that this problem will remain unfixed.
